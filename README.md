How the Code Works:

The genetic algorithm's parameters and settings are initialized using the Settings class. The user is prompted to input the name of the image.

Within the genetic algorithm, a single chromosome is represented by the Chromosome class. It has techniques for mutation and gene flipping, and it starts with random genes.

Until a termination condition is satisfied, the genetic algorithm iterates over several generations, assessing each chromosome's fitness, choosing parents, carrying out crossover and mutation, and producing the following generation.

The user enters the name of the image and the file extension (.png,.jpg). Next, using the given parameters and settings, the computer runs the genetic algorithm to produce an image.

The genetic algorithm iteratively evolves a population of chromosomes to generate an image that closely resembles the target image, using the specified fitness function and genetic operators.
